/* *QUESTION 2*
A warehouse needs a program to audit their stock. You are tasked with writing a program in Java that processes items and identifies which ones need reordering.

1. *Constants & Setup:*
• Create an array called stockLevels with 6 values: {12, 45, 8, 100, 3, 25}.
• Initialize an int reorderCount = 0.
• Initialize an int totalStock = 0.

2. *The Loop:*
• Use a for loop to iterate through all 6 items in the warehouse.

3. *The Logic:*
• For each item, check if the stock is less than 10.
• If it is less than 10: * Print: "Item [i]: [stock] units - CRITICAL: Reorder immediately!".
• Add 1 to your reorderCount.
• If it is 10 or more: * Just print: "Item [i]: [stock] units - Stable".
• Regardless of the amount, add the current stock to your totalStock variable.

4. *Final Summary:*
• After the loop, print the Total Units in Warehouse.
• Print the Total Number of Items to Reorder. */
