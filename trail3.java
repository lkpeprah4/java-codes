/**QUESTION 3*
A deep-sea research station has a limited supply of oxygen. Every time a scientist enters the water, they use a different amount based on the duration of their dive. You are required to write a program in Java to perform the following technical specifications:

1. *Initial Setup:*
• Start with a double oxygenTank = 500.0 (Liters).
• Initialize an int diverCount = 0 to track how many successful dives occurred.

2. *The Loop:*
• Use a while loop that continues as long as oxygenTank is greater than 50.0 (the safety reserve).

3. *The Logic:*
• Inside the loop, prompt the user: "Enter oxygen needed for next dive: ".
• Check for Safety: If the requested oxygen is more than what is currently in the tank, print: "Insufficient oxygen for this dive!" and use the break keyword to end the session.
• Process Dive: If safe, subtract the amount from oxygenTank and add 1 to diverCount.
• Status Alert: If the tank drops below 150.0, print: "WARNING: Oxygen level at [amount] - Return to surface soon.".

4. *Final Summary:*
• After the loop finishes, print: "Total Successful Dives: [diverCount]".
• Print: "Remaining Oxygen: [oxygenTank] Liters".
