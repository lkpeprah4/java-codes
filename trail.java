*QUESTION 4*
A shipping company needs a program to help workers load a delivery truck. The truck has a specific weight limit, and the worker will enter the weight of each package until the truck is full or they choose to stop. You are required to write a program in Java that performs the following technical specifications:

1. *Variables:*
• Set a double weightLimit = 1000.0 (kg).
• Initialize double currentWeight = 0.0.
• Initialize int packageCount = 0.

2. *The Loop:*
• Use a while loop that continues as long as currentWeight is less than weightLimit.
• Sentinel Value: If the user enters -1 for a package weight, the loop should stop immediately (this signifies the worker is done loading).

3. *The Logic:*
• Inside the loop, prompt for the weight of the next package.
• Validation: If the new package would put the truck over the weightLimit, display: "Package too heavy! Truck only has [remaining] kg of space left." and do not add it.
• Accumulation: If the package fits and is not -1, add it to currentWeight and increment packageCount.

4. *Output:*
• After the loop, display the Total Packages Loaded and the Final Weight on the truck.
• If the truck is exactly at 1000.0 kg, display: "TRUCK AT MAXIMUM CAPACITY".
